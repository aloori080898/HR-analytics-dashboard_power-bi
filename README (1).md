# AtliQ  HR Analytic PowerBi Dashboard

# Problem statement:
Atliq needs help keeping track of when employees are present or absent, and how often they work from home. This information is crucial for planning company events and finding ways to save money. Right now, Atliq doesn't have a good way to collect and analyze this data, which makes it hard to make smart decisions about scheduling and cost-cutting. To solve this problem, Atliq is looking for a simple and effective HR analysis solution that can tell them when employees are at work, when they're not, and how often they work from home, so they can plan better and save money.
# Solution:
Atliq can deploy a comprehensive data analytics solution to address HR challenges. By calculating attendance percentages, sick leave percentages, sick leave counts, work from home (WFH) percentage counts, present days, and office working days for each employee, Atliq can gain a deeper understanding of their workforce dynamics. This data-driven approach enables better resource allocation, event planning, and cost-cutting strategies. Leveraging these insights, the company can optimize schedules, incentivize attendance, and improve WFH policies. The result is enhanced operational efficiency, reduced absenteeism, and cost savings, ensuring Atliq can make informed decisions to achieve its objectives in a more streamlined and cost-effective manner.

# Steps Followed in this project
The HR analysis dashboard using Power BI and Excel empowers the HR department at Atliq to make data-driven decisions, optimize workforce management, and facilitate effective program planning based on employee presence, work arrangements, and leave patterns.
